#NetPolyEV-1.0
The PolyVaccine is used for constructing the polytope vaccine, and our program is proposed for focusing on epitope assembly to design polytope vaccines by mainly implementing monte carlo simulated annealing approach, both the order of selected CD8+ T cell epitopes and the spacers with flexible length and sequence are optimized for the polytope vaccine, and the epitope-HLA class I binder is predicted by NetMHCpan-4.1. The method from the tool that is trained with data retrieved from mass spectrometry (MS) experiments known as eluted ligands (EL) is selected for our prediction work because it includes information both about the binding of peptide-MHC, the most selective step in the antigen presentation pathway, and about the prior steps of the antigen presentation pathway. 9 amino acids long, the most common length of the presented MHC class I ligands, is chosen for predicting the epitopes of the polytope vaccine for us. If the peptides are strong binders(SBs) or weak binders(WBs) will be informed based on the %Rank score. In our work, we choose the default threshold %Rank < 0.5 for SBs and %Rank < 2 for WBs for class I.
